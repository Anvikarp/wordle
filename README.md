# wordle-java
### Description
A console-based Java implementation of the popular game, Wordle. Players have 6 attempts to guess a randomly selected 5-letter word. The program gives feedback on each guess by coloring the letters:
- **Green** for correct letters in the correct position.
- **Yellow** for correct letters in the wrong position.
- **No color** for incorrect letters.

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordle-java.git
2. Ensure you have Java installed on your machine.
3. Compile and run the program
   ```bash
   javac WordleMain.java
   java WordleMain
4. Make sure wordle.txt is in the same directory as the .java files


### Future Improvements
- Add a GUI for a more interactive experience.
- Disable players from entering guesses that are not real words
